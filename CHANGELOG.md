# Changelog

Notable changes to KNXpilot. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this file starts from the
restructuring below — history before that is available via `git log`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Toast notifications and a custom confirm modal (`frontend/js/ui.js`),
  replacing every native `alert()`/`confirm()` call across the frontend
  (24 + 7 call sites).
- An open-circuit-count badge on the Abgangsliste sub-tab button (e.g.
  "Abgangsliste (3)"), mirroring the existing Klärungsliste badge pattern.
- A new "Übersicht" sub-tab (`frontend/js/uebersicht.js`), now the default
  landing sub-tab when opening a project — 5 clickable status cards (one
  per other sub-tab) summarizing floors/rooms/points, circuit assignment
  progress, planned device count, and open Klärungen at a glance, each
  jumping straight to the relevant sub-tab on click.

### Changed

- Restructured the project into separate `backend/` (FastAPI) and
  `frontend/` (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step) directories, replacing the
  previous single `app/` directory whose `static/index.html` held the
  entire frontend inline.
- Split the 1800-line monolithic `frontend/index.html` into a CSS file
  (`frontend/css/style.css`) and one JS file per UI tab/sub-tab under
  `frontend/js/`, mirroring the existing one-router-per-tab structure of
  the backend. No behavior changes.
- Added `CLAUDE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and `DEPLOYMENT.md`; trimmed the
  corresponding "Persistenz & Deployment" and "Code-Struktur" sections out
  of `README.md` in favor of pointers to the new files.
- Updated `Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, and `docker-compose.yml` comments for
  the new `backend/`/`frontend/` paths (the repo-wide bind mount itself is
  unaffected).
- Added a "Keep docs in sync with code changes" section to `CLAUDE.md`.

### Fixed

- `DEPLOYMENT.md`'s Proxmox instructions named `docker-compose-plugin`/
  `docker-ce` as an apt-installable fallback without noting that those are
  Docker's own package names, not Ubuntu's — `apt install` silently fails
  the whole transaction (including `docker.io`) when one package name
  doesn't resolve. Fixed to use Ubuntu's own `docker-compose-v2` package
  (no third-party repo needed), with Docker's official install script kept
  as a documented fallback for distros where that package isn't available.
